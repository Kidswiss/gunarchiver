# gunarchiver

gunarchiver (Go Unarchiver) is a small archive extraction tool.

# Future Work:

(not necessarily implemented soon or ever)

- Extend README ;)
- UI for other platforms (Linux, macOS). But low priority since other platform already have similar tools that inspired me to develop this one.
- Preferences pane for customization.
- i18n (currently hardcoded to english)
- Move files to trash (optionally?) instead of permanent delete
- Add Program Icon
